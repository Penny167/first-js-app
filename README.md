# Project Description

The objective of this project was to build a small web application with HTML, CSS,
and JavaScript that loads data from an external API and enables the viewing of
data points in detail.

- This project uses the Pokemon API: pokeapi.
- Data is retrieved using the JavaScript Fetch API.
- Detailed data points are displayed within a custom modal.

- Summary data is displayed on loading the page. Detailed data is fetched as needed
- when the user clicks a selected pokemon button to reduce page loading time.

- JavaScript has been linted using ESLint default rules.
