Pokédex is a simple, responsive web application built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript that uses data from an external API to create a directory of Pokémons. Users can scroll through the directory and click on a Pokémon to view further details, which are displayed in a modal.

## Key Features

- The application uses the native JavaScript Fetch API to retrieve Pokémon data from the PokéApi.
- On launching the application the user is presented with a directory of all Pokémon. They can scroll through the list and click on any Pokémon to see more details; a modal will pop up displaying the Pokémon's name, height and image. The modal can be dismissed either by clicking its close button or the screen outside the modal.
- Separate API endpoints are used for the summary data in the directory and the detailed data about individual Pokémon in order to reduce page loading times.
- The application has been styled using bespoke css with fun colours and hover effects.
- Fetch and Promise polyfills have been used to provide support for older browsers.
- Media queries have been used to make the application responsive.
- The JavaScript has been linted using ESLint default rules.
- The application has been published to GitHub pages and is accessible using the live website link above.
